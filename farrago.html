    <h2>Mini Projects</h2>
    <ul id="publication">

      <li><b>A 16-bit RISC CPU on an FPGA</b> - <i>(Autumn 2009)</i> <br />
        Instructor: Prof. D. Sarkar, <i>Computer Organisation &amp; Architecture</i> <br />
        -- <a href="files/2010_CPU_Report.pdf">Design Document &amp; Report</a> <br />
        -- Verilog Source Codes : Datapath, Controller, Memory, Interrupt Handler. (<a href="files/2010_CPU_Source.tar.gz">Download Archive</a>)
      </li>

      <li><b>Compiler for a subset of C language</b> - <i>(Autumn 2009)</i> <br />
        Instructor: Prof. Goutam Biswas, <i>Compiler Design</i> <br />
        The language is a highly simplified version of C language. Some
        features have been removed or tweaked in order to help the
        implementation. The final target code is generated for Intel
        XEON x86-36, assembly language. <br />
        -- The language specification in context free grammar.
          (<a href="files/2010_compiler/grammar.txt">Grammar.txt</a>) <br />
        -- The lexical analyser, written using <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">flex</a>.
            (<a href="files/2010_compiler/compiler.l">compiler.l</a>) <br />
        -- The parsing code, written in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a>.
          (<a href="files/2010_compiler/compiler.y">compiler.y</a>) <br />
        -- The <a href="files/2010_compiler/Makefile">Makefile</a>, and some
          <a href="files/2010_compiler/sample.txt">sample programs</a>
      </li>

      <li><b>Fortune's algorithm with <i>O(nlogn)</i> complexity
        for voronoi diagrams</b> - <i>(Autumn 2008)</i> <br />
        Instructor: Prof. Partha Bhowmick, <i>Algorithms 1</i> -
        <a href="files/2008_Voronoi_Report.pdf">Report</a> -
        <a href="files/2008_Voronoi_Source.tar.gz">Source Files</a>
      </li>

      <li><b>Ludo &amp; Hangman in Turbo C++</b> - <i>(circa December 2005)</i> <br />
        -- This was my first attempt at writing some big piece of code. At
        school, we were taught in Turbo C<tt></tt> and had no idea about
        graphics libraries. Me and my partner decided to make this game
        using Turbo's primitive graphics commands in DOS. This was special
        because I used to bunk my classes and stay in the computer lab to
        complete it.<br />
        -- The <a href="files/2005_ludopro.cpp">LUDO Code</a>,
            <a href="files/2005_hangman.cpp">Hangman Code</a>.
            Now I run these using <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a>.<br /><br />

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I don't believe in weakness... it costs too much. -- Lyman Zerga</li>

      <li>Education is an admirable thing. But it is well to remember
      from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be
      taught. -- Oscar Wilde</li>

      <li>Why should a financial engineer be paid 4-100 times more than
      a real engineer? A real engineer builds bridges - a financial
      engineer builds dreams and when these dreams turn out to be
      nightmares other people pay for it. -- Andrew Sheng (Chief Advisor
      China Banking Regulatory Commission)</li>

      <li>A quotation is to speech what salt is to food. -- Arabic Proverb</li>

      <li>Nearly every man who develops an idea works at it up to the
      point where it looks impossible, and then gets discouraged. That's
      not the place to become discouraged. -- Thomas Edison</li>

      <li>Religions die when they are proved to be true. Science is the
      record of dead religions. -- Oscar Wilde</li>

      <li>There is only one pretty child in the world... and every
      mother has it. -- Chinese Proverb</li>

      <li>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
      place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible,
      you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. -- Brian
      Kernighan</li>

      <li>A common mistake that people make when trying to design
      something completely foolproof was to underestimate the ingenuity
      of complete fools. -- Douglas Adams</li>

      <li>Its not always that you get to hit the iron when it's hot; I
      believe in hitting it so hard that it gets hot!! -- Anonymous</li>

      <li>People who count their chickens before they are hatched, act
      very wisely, because chickens run about so absurdly that it is
      impossible to count them accurately. -- Oscar Wilde</li>

      <li>Winning is like a drug, I cannot justify in any circumstances
      coming second or third, because being second is to be the first of
      the ones who lose. -- Ayrton Senna</li>

      <li>Programming today is a race between software engineers
      striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the
      Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the
      Universe is winning. -- Unknown</li>
